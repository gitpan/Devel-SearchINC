Revision history for Perl extension Devel::SearchINC.

1.2   Sun Sep  1 12:06:22 CEST 2002
	- tests now use Test::More and have been reorganized
	- added a debugging option and verbose debugging output
	- previously it tried to open last guess regardless of whether
	  the search loop was ended because there were no more paths to
	  search or because it found a file. So I introduced a $found
	  variable that takes care of that.
