    version: 1.03
  - author: 'Marcel Gruenauer <marcel@cpan.org>'
    changes:
      - tests now use Test::More and have been reorganized
      - added a debugging option and verbose debugging output
      - previously it tried to open last guess regardless of whether the search loop was ended because there were no more paths to search or because it found a file. So I introduced a $found variable that takes care of that.
