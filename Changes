Revision history for Perl extension Devel-SearchINC

1.35 Thu Oct 30 16:32:55 CET 2008 (Marcel Gruenauer <marcel@cpan.org>)
     - If a module is found, set its entry in %INC to avoid the
       '/loader/0x1234567/Foo/Bar.pm' effect, so it works nicely with
       Devel::NYTProf

1.34  Thu Jul 25 15:27:43 CEST 2008 (Marcel Gruenauer <marcel@cpan.org>)
     - Changed dist style and Changes back to standard. People didn't like it -
       the nail that sticks out gets hammered down.
     - Added standard test files; this will also help with CPANTS.
     - Devel::SearchINC now uses File::Find::find() like
       Devel::SearchINC::FindLib does, and caches the result during the first
       pass. So this is more flexible than the previous version and allows you
       to use Devel::SearchINC with complex development directory setups,
       without the disadvantage of Devel::SearchINC::FindLib cluttering up your
       @INC.

     - fixed version requirement of Test::More

1.31  Wed, 03 Oct 2007 17:27:25 +0200 (Marcel Gruenauer <marcel@cpan.org>)
     - changed the $VERSION of all modules to '1.31'.
     - switched back to Makefile.PL and to Module::AutoInstall

1.03  Thu, 17 Feb 2005 23:53:39 +0100 (Marcel Gruenauer <marcel@cpan.org>)
     - added Devel::SearchINC::FindLib

1.02  Sun, 01 Sep 2002 12:06:22 +0200 (Marcel Gruenauer <marcel@cpan.org>)
     - tests now use Test::More and have been reorganized
     - added a debugging option and verbose debugging output
     - previously it tried to open last guess regardless of whether the search
       loop was ended because there were no more paths to search or because it
       found a file. So I introduced a $found variable that takes care of that.
