Revision history for Perl extension Devel::SearchINC.

1.31  Mi Okt  3 17:27:25 CEST 2007
    - changed the $VERSION of all modules to '1.31'.
    - switched back to Makefile.PL and to Module::AutoInstall
    - uses Module::Install::StandardTests

1.03  Thu Feb 17 23:53:39 CET 2005
    - added Devel::SearchINC::FindLib
    - switched to Build.PL

1.02  Sun Sep  1 12:06:22 CEST 2002
    - tests now use Test::More and have been reorganized
    - added a debugging option and verbose debugging output
    - previously it tried to open last guess regardless of whether
      the search loop was ended because there were no more paths to
      search or because it found a file. So I introduced a $found
      variable that takes care of that.
