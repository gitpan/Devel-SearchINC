NAME
    Devel::SearchINC - loading Perl modules from their development dirs

SYNOPSIS
      use Devel::SearchINC '/my/dev/dir';
      use My::Brand::New::Module;

DESCRIPTION
    When developing a new module, I always start with

        h2xs -XA -n My::Module

    This creates a directory with a useful skeleton for the module's
    distribution. The directory structure is such, however, that you have to
    install the module first (with "make install") before you can use it in
    another program or module. For example, bringing in a module like so:

        use My::Module;

    requires the module to be somewhere in a path listed in @INC, and the
    relative path is expected to be "My/Module.pm". However, "h2xs" creates
    a structure where the module ends up in "My/Module/Module.pm".

    This module tries to compensate for that. The idea is that you "use()"
    it right at the beginning of your program so it can modify @INC to look
    for modules in relative paths of the special structure mentioned above,
    starting with directories specified along with the "use()" statement
    (i.e. the arguments passed to this module's "import()").

    This is useful because with this module you can test your programs using
    your newly developed modules without having to install them just so you
    can use them. This is especially advantageous when you consider working
    on many new modules at the same time.

    If our fictional module isn't found in "My/Module/Module.pm", we try to
    find it in "My/Module/lib/My/Module.pm", which might be the case if it's
    part of a larger family of modules that takes advantage of
    "ExtUtils::MakeMaker"'s "PMLIBDIRS" mechanism.

    To automatically make your development modules available to all your
    scripts, you can place the following in your ".bashrc" (or your shell
    initialization file of choice):

      export PERL5OPT=-MDevel::SearchINC=/my/dev/dir

    Since the syntax for this is buried in the perlrun manpage, you might
    consider adding this example to the "Devel::SearchINC" docs.

    Note that there is a small limitation for the "PERL5OPT" approach:
    development modules can't be loaded via "-M" on the perl command line.
    So the following won't work:

      $ export PERL5OPT=-MDevel::SearchINC=/my/dev/dir
      $ perl -MMy::Brand::New::Module -e'print "hello world\n"'

    This is probably because "PERL5OPT" options are appended to the perl
    command line, and processed after the actual command line options.

    Also, the "PERL5OPT" variable is ignored when Taint checks are enabled.

TODO
    Test on different platforms and Perl versions.
