NAME
    Devel::SearchINC - loading Perl modules from their development dirs

SYNOPSIS
      use Devel::SearchINC '/my/dev/dir';
      use My::Brand::New::Module;

DESCRIPTION
    When developing a new module, I always start with

        h2xs -XA -n My::Module

    This creates a directory with a useful skeleton for the module's
    distribution. The directory structure is such, however, that you have to
    install the module first (with `make install') before you can use it in
    another program or module. For example, bringing in a module like so:

        use My::Module;

    requires the module to be somewhere in a path listed in `@INC', and the
    relative path is expected to be `My/Module.pm'. However, `h2xs' creates
    a structure where the module ends up in `My/Module/Module.pm'.

    This module tries to compensate for that. The idea is that you `use()'
    it right at the beginning of your program so it can modify `@INC' to
    look for modules in relative paths of the special structure mentioned
    above, starting with directories specified along with the `use()'
    statement (i.e. the arguments passed to this module's `import()').

    This is useful because with this module you can test your programs using
    your newly developed modules without having to install them just so you
    can use them. This is especially advantageous when you consider working
    on many new modules at the same time.

TODO
    Test on different platforms and Perl versions.
